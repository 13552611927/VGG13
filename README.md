# CIFAR100
///This project uses the CIFAR100 datasets from tensorflow.keras datasets///
***
GPUs are recommanded because the depth of this net are 13 layers(convolution(10) + Dense(3)), and there are 5 layers of MaxPooling as well.  
CPUs are not recommanded for the slow rate of proccessing data and training for decreasing the loss.

Hope this program could be useful to those who want to make their computers learn classification!
